- Playing around with the Strak Machine for testing purposes, this is my first attempt to create an
  alternative for the well known RG15 airfoil, but as a "flap"-airfoil

- That means, with flap usage the different operating points of RG15 can be achieved and are even better
- The XFLR5-file "RG15_NG15_comparison.xfl" will compare both airfoils with different flap angles at the "NG15"

- The suffix _150k, _100k etc. stands for the ReSqrt(CL)-area the airfoil is intended for

- The airfoils are my first attempt (only a small amount of time was spent), so they are not perfect.
- The airfoils have still some weaknesses, like not matching zero lift angle (to be improved in the future)

- The file "NG15_Strak.xfl" can be opened with XFRL5 to get an overview about the airfoils and their polars
- The "angular" / not rounded polars are the "target"-polars, that represent the objectives for the optimizer
